# Time Series Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of time series data aimed at improving and understanding the dynamics of variance and volatility measures. 


## Data Description

The dataset "data_exam.xlsx" contains three columns of interest:
- Column B: VIX level
- Column C: Parkinson estimates
- Column D: Squared returns

### Task 1: Data Exploration 

- **Objective**: Understand the concept behind each column and transform the time series for comparability.
- **Approach**: Provide a detailed explanation of each time series, including their significance in financial analysis. Apply necessary transformations to make the series comparable in scale and order.

### Task 2: Autoregressive (AR) Model Estimation 

- **Objective**: Estimate an AR model for each time series and determine the AR process order.
- **Approach**: Present the order of the AR process and the estimates. Analyze and conclude from these estimations.

### Task 3: Model Fitting and Comparison 

- **Objective**: Compare the fitted values against the original time series.
- **Approach**: Plot and discuss why these fitted values are useful for measuring volatility.

### Task 4: Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR) Model Estimation 

- **Objective**: Estimate an HAR model for each series, compare models, and select the preferred one.
- **Approach**: Present the estimated coefficients, loglikelihood comparisons, and retain the fitted values for the selected model.

### Task 5: Stationarity Test 

- **Objective**: Test the stationarity of the estimated time series.
- **Approach**: Conduct stationarity tests, document the methodology, and comment on the results.

### Task 6: Vector Autoregression (VAR) Model Estimation 

- **Objective**: Estimate a VAR model on the stationary fitted values.
- **Approach**: Comment on the estimation results and the implications of the findings.

### Task 7: Impulse Response Function Analysis 

- **Objective**: Plot and analyze the impulse response function from the VAR model.
- **Approach**: Discuss the results and their significance in understanding the time series dynamics.
